# Python File Handling Assignment

## Overview

This is a Python script that demonstrates basic file handling operations. The script performs the following tasks:

1. **File Creation**: Creates a new text file named `my_file.txt` in write mode and writes three lines of text, including a mix of strings and numbers.
2. **File Reading**: Reads and displays the contents of `my_file.txt` after the initial writing.
3. **File Appending**: Opens the same file in append mode and adds three more lines of text. Finally, it displays the updated contents of the file.

# to run the file 
Ensure you have python: python --version

# on your terminal run the following command
python file_handling_assignment.py   or the name of the file the way you named it

# output example

Reading the contents of 'my_file.txt:
Hello lazor, this is line 1. 
This is line two with some numbers: 12345.
Third line just to conclude.

Reading the contents of 'my_file.txt' after appending:
Hello lazor, this is line 1. 
This is line two with some numbers: 12345.
Third line just to conclude.
This is the append line 4.
Appending line 5 with a number: 2540.
I just added this as line six to show it really works.
